                    Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole
                    process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through
                    these systems, users are able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return
                    back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs
                    around the world which is composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exists
                    great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and
                    health issues. Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike sharing systems, the
                    characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the
                    research.
                    The goal here is to build an end-to-end regression task. Here the user will provide the
                    data and the result will be given by the best performing hyper tuned Machine Learning
                    model. The user will also get privileges to choose the deployment options.
